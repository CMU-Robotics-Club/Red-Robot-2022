# Red-Robot-2022

Code for CMU RoboClub's Red Robot Hackathon (2022)

The starter code is in ** RRarduino.ino **.

You should use the Arduino IDE in order to add the PSX_Lib library as a .zip file.

You'll also need to install the "Adafruit Motor Drivers" library via the Arduino IDE's library manager.

If '#define PS2X_COM_DEBUG' isn't enabled in the library already, you might need to do that as well.
